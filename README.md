# Sorting Algorithms #
This repo contains python implementations of all the famous
sorting algorithms. 

## Timing ##
Most of these are pretty fast. The Sub-Sort
algo can sort this:
```shell
[213, 2143, 21413, 3423, 0, 214312, 3,
	3, 23, 34, 3423, 256, 214, 213,
	9021342534, 210231, 2, 3423, 9, 212, 4]
```
In:
```shell
0.00000000017032300002028933
```
