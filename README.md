# Sorting Algorithms #
This repo contains python implementations of all the famous
sorting algorithms. 

## Testing the Sub-Sort Algorithm ##
The common Sub-Sort Algorithm is one of the fastest sorting algos.

from numpy.random import rand as r
from subsort import subsort as s

x = r(3, 2)

x = s(x)
print(x)

```
